ShiVa AI for EDTracker2 head tracking support

Oculus gives you headaches? Don’t want to throw away your 50” gaming screen? Looking for a little more immersion in your games without breaking the bank? Then you have come to the right place! With EDTracker 2, you have a very cost-effective way of getting into “sortof” VR without getting motion sick from tiny screens that are glued to your face.

This AI is the preliminary EDTracker 2 implementation for pitch and yaw. It comes with the standalone AI, a tutorial document, a demo game (win32) and the demo project files for the FPS sources.

Thanks a lot to Dan and Rob from edtracker.org.uk for their support and developing an awesome little device!
